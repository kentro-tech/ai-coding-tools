## TECH STACK

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
- When writing blog posts, mimic the style, conciseness, depth, and approachability of Isaac Flath's work, such as demonstrated in blog posts like [Late Chunking](@https://isaacflath.com/blog/blog_post?fpath=posts%2F2025-04-08-LateChunking.ipynb). This includes:
    1.  Clear problem statement upfront - starts with a concrete example of the problem
    2.  Practical focus - shows actual code implementations
    3.  Progressive disclosure - builds from simple to complex
    4.  Visual aids and examples throughout
    5.  Balanced technical depth with accessibility
    6.  Conversational but informative tone
    7.  Uses code blocks extensively to demonstrate concepts
    8.  Includes helpful tips/notes in callout boxes
    9.  Acknowledges resources and gives credit
    10. Focuses on "why it matters" and practical applications

    When writing documentation, the goal is to create a concise reference that allows for objective assessment and saves developers time, rather than creating promotional content. Documentation must be factual, objective, and avoid sales-oriented language.
