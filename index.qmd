# Hey, I'm Isaac Flath

I've been deep in the AI coding tools space, testing everything from Cursor to Windsurf to see what actually delivers. Just honest reviews and techniques based on real coding sessions.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Guides**: Universal Techniques and Concepts for using and curating context for AI
- **Unbiased Reviews**: I pay for these tools and try them myself
- **Real Code Examples**: Hear exactly what tasks I used them
- **Practical Insights**: What works, what doesn't, and when to use each tool
- **Condensed Information**: I've condensed the information to the most useful so you don't need to spend hours on every tool to know what's worth your time to try for yourself.
